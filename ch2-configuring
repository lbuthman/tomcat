- There are situations where you need to relocate different web app directories. One case is with custom configuration files;
an upgrade to the system could overwrite files in default positions. Another is if more than one instance is being run
simultaneously. Steps are found in book to relocate.

- Default installation puts the port on 8080 -> change to 80 most likely, or relay TCP connections to 8080 using Service Wrapper

- The heap settings for allocating memory are important to understand.
  * If configured for a small starting heap memory size and a larger maximum size, page response will suffer while the Java
  VM grows to its max size. This is because it takes time to reallocate memory chunks while Tomcat is trying to serve responses.
  To solve, set -Xms and -Xmx to the same values
  
- The security of a web application's resources can be controlled by the container ("container-managed") or by the web app
itself ("application-managed").

- Users and Passwords are managed in groups called "realms".
