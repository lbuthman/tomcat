What I Expect / Hope To Find

  - An understanding of how to deploy a webapp in Tomcat in a way that is accessible with my public url.
  
Final Takeaway

- I don't think this will work with Maven since the dir structure is very different.
- What I really need is to continue build/test my webapp with Maven and other frameworks and then deploy a WAR or
unpacked dir structure to dedicated webapp server, most likely in my Google Cloud.

What I Actually Found

In this chapter, we focus on three main webapp deployment scenarios:
  - Deploying an unpackedwebapp directory into a Tomcat instance on the same machine.
  - Deploying a WAR file into a Tomcat on the same machine.
  - Deploying an unpackedwebapp directory or WAR file into a Tomcat instance (local or remote) over a TCP network 
  connection to the Manager webapp.
  
<maybeRelevant>configURI in server.xml to target host. Is that my URL Domain or is the host something else that needs
to be setup.</maybeRelevant>

<strangeEncounters>Context, Host, Engine, standalone deployer program, buried paths for finding host and context XML
fragments, Manager Web application for deployment, deploying WARs vs unpacked webapp dirs with a preference for unpacked
webapp dirs</strangeEncounters>
