What I Expect / Hope To Find

  - An understanding of how to deploy a webapp in Tomcat in a way that is accessible with my public url.

What I Actually Found

In this chapter, we focus on three main webapp deployment scenarios:
  - Deploying an unpackedwebapp directory into a Tomcat instance on the same machine.
  - Deploying a WAR file into a Tomcat on the same machine.
  - Deploying an unpackedwebapp directory or WAR file into a Tomcat instance (local or remote) over a TCP network 
  connection to the Manager webapp.
