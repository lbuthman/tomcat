- Tomcat invocation scripts
  - catalina -> main Tomcat script, runs Java commands to start and shutdown
  - cpappend -> windows only (?)
  - digest -> makes crypto digest of Tomcat passwords
  - service -> windows service only (?)
  - setclasspath -> sets Tomcat classpath and other environmental variables
  - shutdown -> runs "catalina stop" to shutdown Tomcat
  - startup -> runs "catalina start" to start up Tomcat
  - tool-wrapper -> generic command-line tool wrapper to set up environmental variables and then call the main method of any
  fully qualified class in the classpath (used internally be digest)
  - version -> run "catalina version" for Tomcat's version info

- See chapter for setting size of memory, very important

- There is a discussion of how to restart that will become relevant later.
